## [SBE_compiled_data_2002-2024.csv](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10815814)
This dataset contains the data collected from a number of experiments that were conducted within the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment (SBE) project site located within the Malua Forest Reserve in Sabah, Malaysia between 2002 to 2020. The data collected are measurements taken from 16 species of Dipterocarpaceae seedlings that were planted within the project site. These measurements largely comprise of the diameters at base and breast height of the main stems (in centimeters), the height of the main stem (in centimeters), densiometer readings to determine canopy openness, and the level of herbivory experienced by seedlings.
